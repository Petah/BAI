h1. Balanced Annihiliation AI (BAI)

h2. Features:
* Multithreading (including caching of most of Spring's data so it can be accessed on other threads)
* GUI visualisation (including height maps, threat maps, target maps, movement islands, etc)
* Real time adjustable JavaScript interface (WIP)
* Team cooperation
* Multiple strategies (porc, rush, eco, etc)
* Resource sharing

h2. Commands:
* -showgui, -hidegui
* -allcheat (enables cheating, currently it shouldn't affect anything)
* -hi (says hello world, to make sure the AI is still there)
* -dir (display some debug information about the directories)
* -savesettings (save the current options to a file)


p. If you are going to use the GUI I recommend you run spring in window mode.
